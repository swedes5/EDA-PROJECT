# EDA-PROJECT

The EDA abstrant and description file is my write up explaining the presmise and tools used in the project.  
The EDA presentation file is my Google Slides presentation of my initial findings about the data.  
The Untitled.ipynb file is my Jupyter Notebook where I wrote the code for this project. 

This project was about finding the busiest and least busy days the MTA faces every year.  I looked at a few holidays and came to the conclusion that some holidays see reduced traffic and some see almost identical traffic to their corresponding day of the week on a non-holiday.
